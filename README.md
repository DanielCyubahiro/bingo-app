# Movie Bingo üìΩÔ∏èüé¨üçø

Welcome to **Movie Bingo**! A fun, interactive game to enjoy during virtual movie nights with friends. Mark off the movie phrases as you hear them, and try to get as many **Bingos** as possible by the end of the movie. 

## Game Overview

Movie Bingo is a 5x5 bingo card filled with movie phrases. The goal is to mark off the phrases as you hear them throughout the movie. There are two ways to win:

1. **Movie Bingo**: The first player to mark off all the phrases (a full card) wins.
2. **Most Bingos**: If no one gets a full card by the end of the movie, the player with the most complete rows of 5 cards(horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.

Stay engaged, have fun, and see who can get the most bingos before the movie ends!
